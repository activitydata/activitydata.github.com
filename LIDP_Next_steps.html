Although this project has had a finite goal in proving or disproving the hypothesis, we would now 
like to go back to the original project which provided the inspiration. This was to seek to engage 
low/non users of library resources and to raise student achievement by increasing the use of 
library resources.</div>
<div align="left">
 This has certainly been a popular theme in questions at the SCONUL and LIBER conferences, so 
we feel there is a lot of interest in this in the library community. Some of these ideas have also 
been discussed at the recent <a href=
"http://library.hud.ac.uk/blogs/projects/lidp/2011/07/15/talking-to-business-librarians-at-the-bla-conference/"
   target=
   "_blank"><span>Business Librarians Association Conference</span></a><span>
.</span></div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
There are a number of ways of doing this, some based on business intelligence and others 
based on targeting staffing resources. However, we firmly believe that although there is a 
business intelligence string to what we would like to take forward, the real benefits will be 
achieved by actively engaging with the students to improve their experience. We think this 
could be covered in a number of ways.</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Gender and socio-economic background? This came out in questions from library directors at 
SCONUL and LIBER. We need to re-visit the data to see whether there are any effects of 
gender, nationality (UK, other European and international could certainly be investigated) and 
socio- economic background in use and attainment.</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
We need to look into what types of data are needed by library directors, eg for the scenario &#8216;if 
budget cuts result in less resources, does attainment fall&#8217;? The Balanced Scorecard approach 
could be used for this?  
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
We are keen to see if we add value as a library through better use of resources and we 
have thought of a number of possible scenarios in which we would like to investigate 
further:</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Does a student who comes in with high grades leave with high grades? If so why? 
What do they use that makes them so successful?</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
What if a student comes in with lower grades but achieves a higher grade on graduation 
after using library resources? What did they do to show this improvement?</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Quite often students who look to be heading for a 2nd drop to a 3rd in the final part of 
their course, why is this so?</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
What about high achievers that don't use our resources? What are they doing in order 
to be successful and should we be adopting what they do in our resources/literacy 
skills sessions?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
We have not investigated VLE use, and it would be interesting to see if this had an effect</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
We have set up meetings with the University of Wollongong (Australia) and Mary Ellen Davis 
(executive director of ACRL) to discuss the project further. In addition we have had interest 
from the Netherlands and Denmark for future work surrounding the improvement of student 
attainment through increased use of resources</li>
</ul>
<div align="left">
In respect to targeting non/low users we would like to achieve the following:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Find out what students on selected &#8216;non-low use&#8217; courses think to understand why students 
do not engage</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
To check the amount and type of contact subject teams have had with the specific courses to 
compare library hours to attainment (poor attainment does not reflect negatively on the library 
support!)</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Use data already available to see if there is correlation across all years of the courses. We 
have some interesting data on course year, some courses have no correlation in year one with 
final grade, but others do. By delving deeper into this we could target our staffing resources 
more effectively to help students at the point of demand.

<li style=

Does use of resources + wider reading lead to better attainment - indeed, is this what 
high achievers actually do?  </li>
</ul>

Net Generation students tend to overestimate their own skills and then demonstrate 
poor critical analysis once they get onto resources.</li>

Ultimately our goal will be to help increase student engagement with the library and its resources, 
which as we can now prove, leads to better attainment. This work would also have an impact on 
library resources, by helping to target our precious staff resources in the right place at the right 
time and to make sure that we are spending limited funds on the resources most needed to help 
improve student attainment.</div>

There has been a lot of interest from other universities throughout the project. Some universities 
may want to take our research as proof in itself and just look at their own data; we have provided 
instructions on how to do this at 
<a href=
"http://library.hud.ac.uk/blogs/files/lidp/Documentation/DataRequirements.pdf"
   target=
   "_blank"><span>http://library.hud.ac.uk/blogs/files/lidp/Documentation/DataRequirements.pdf</span></a><span>
. We will also make 
available the recipes written with the Synthesis project in the documentation area of the blog, we 
will be adding specific recipes for different library management systems in the coming weeks: </span>

For those libraries that want to do their own statistical analysis, this was a was a complex issue 
for the project, particularly given the nature of the data we could obtain vs. the nature of the data 
required to specifically find correlations. As a result, we used the Kruskal Wallis (KW) test, 
designed to measure whether there are differences between groups of non- normally distributed 
data. To confirm non-normal distribution, a Kolmogorov- Smirnov test was run. KW unfortunately 
does not tell us where differences are, the Mann Whitney test was used on specific couplings of 
degree results, selected based on visual data represented in boxplot graphs. The number of Mann 
Whitney tests have to be limited as the more tests conducted, the higher the significance value 
required, so we limited them to three (at a required significance value of 0.0167 (5% divided by 3)). 
Once Mann Whitney tests had been conducted, effect size of the difference was calculated. All 
tests other than effect size were run in PASW 18; effect size was calculated manually. It should 
be noted that we are aware the size of the samples we are dealing with could have indicated 
relationships where they do not exist, but we feel our visual data demonstrates relationships that 
are confirmed by the analytics, and thus that we have a stable conclusion in our discarding of the 
null hypothesis that there is no relationship between library use and degree result.</div>

Full instructions of how the tests were run will first be made available to partner institutions and 
disseminated publicly through a toolkit in July/August</div></div>
