<div id="main_content"><div align="left">
<b>Purpose of Business case</b></div>
<div align="left">
The most important thing to remember when developing a business case is that its purpose is to 
persuade someone to release resources for the proposed activity. This will primarily be money  or 
staff  time in most cases. It makes little difference whether this is re-allocating staff to a new 
project,  employing new staff or contracting for the service.</div>
<div align="left">
The person who will have to make the decision has a wide variety of competing requests and 
demands on the available resources, so that what they need to know is how the proposed  project 
will  benefit <b>them</b>. Note that while this should be about benefits to them in their role they  are 
people with  particular interests and desires (including keeping their job and their next  promotion). 
The question  that they need the answer to is why should I use the resources on  this project rather 
than some of  the others? </div>
<div align="left">
The answer to this question should be that it helps them move towards their strategic goals. So 
the  first thing that you need to find out is what their strategic goals are. These could be around 
cost  savings (very likely in the current economic client), improving the student experience, 
increasing the  use of resources. You should then select one (or at most two) of these goals  and 
explain how the  project will help to meet this goal (or goals).</div>
<div align="left">
You may feel that the project can address many goals, and it is possible that this is true, but  you 
need to choose the ones that are central to the person you are writing the case for.  Aligning the 
project to many goals has the danger of diluting each of them and having less  impact than a 
strong  case for a single goal.</div>
<div align="left">
The business case is intended to enable the decision maker to make an informed decision  based 
on  the (potential) benefits, the costs and the risks and how this particular project would  further 
their  strategic goals. It doesn't require academic rigour, but it does require evidence</div>
<div align="left"><b>Structure</b></div>
<div align="left">
A business case, like a bid for funding or a student essay, must answer the questions that the 
person reading it has. A typical business case of the type we need here will have the following 
structure:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 3mm;">
<b>Title</b>. Should be short and descriptive (eg Proposal to use data from the VLE and SRS to 
identify students at risk of dropping out).</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 3mm;">
<b>Intended audience. </b>While this would not normally form part of a business case this  would, 
it  will be helpful for other people reading this business case and considering how  they might 
use  it for themselves. Essentially, the intended audience should be the  budget holder who 
will  benefit from the project. Why would the librarian want to pay for a  project that only 
benefits  student services when there are plenty of projects that they  would like to fund of 
benefit to the  library? Examples might include head of student  service, librarian, PVC for 
teaching and  learning. </li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 3mm;">
<b>Brief description</b> of what is being proposed. This should focus on the effect that will be 
achieved when the result is delivered. It is best to avoid technical descriptions, and to give 
the  reader some concrete benefits from the project. (See panel for a brief example). The 
level of  detail should be appropriate to the size of the project and the audience that it is 
intended for.  The description will be fleshed out further in the main part of the business 
case, the idea is that  the reader can quickly understand what the proposal covers and 
provides some context for all  that follows which will include the details needed to support  an 
informed decision. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="action">
<div align="left"><b>Brief description</b></div>
<div align="left">
<b>For a VLE activity data project</b></div>
<div align="left">
The University of Wigan has a significant problem with non- 
completion by students. Currently 21% of all undergraduate 
students fail to complete, with half of those dropping out in the 
 first year. Evidence demonstrates that early identification of 
students at risk of dropping out followed by active intervention 
could reduce this to 18% gaining the University &#163;3million per 
year in additional HEFCE and student income. This project will 
 use data that is collected by the attendance system and VLE 
 to automatically identify students displaying at risk patterns 
of  behaviour, thereby enabling student services and personal 
tutors to focus their efforts where they will have the greatest 
impact.</div>
</blockquote>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 3mm;">
<b>Alternative options</b>. There are always alternative options that could be implemented to 
achieve the same business goal, and it is important to show that you have considered  them 
and explain why the proposed option is superior. Note that these are not technical 
alternatives  (or at least not only technical alternatives), but alternative approaches to 
achieving the same  benefit that this project is seeking to achieve. For instance, an 
alternative to using activity data  for the early identification of students at risk might be 
reports from tutors. The important thing in  these business cases is to demonstrate that  you 
have considered alternatives and have valid  reasons for the choice that you made.  This may 
be because the cost is lower, the benefits are  higher or the risks are lower. </li>
</ul>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:10mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
For each alternative you should</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: 19mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Provide a brief description of the approach, highlighting the key differences 
from  the approach proposed</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 19mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Describe the benefits of the alternative approach (lower cost, less staff 
development, fewer risks, no legal implications&#8230;..)</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 19mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Describe the costs and risks associated with the alternative</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 19mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Summarise the reasons for rejecting this approach in favour of the selected 
approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:17mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;"></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:10mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
Do not &#8220;over egg the pudding&#8221; in terms of overstating the costs and risks or understating  the 
 benefits. If the alternatives are not credible then the business case may be rejected  as it 
appears to be not offering realistic alternatives.</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 3mm;">
<b>Benefits. </b>This is where you outline the benefits of the project. Remember that the  business 
case is aimed at a particular person (role), who will be funding the project either  with cash or 
 by allocating staff time. They are primarily interested in benefits that address  <b>
their</b> strategic 
 goals. Or, to put it another way, why would they pay for a project if the  benefits fall 
elsewhere, they would expect them to pay for the project. It therefore may be </li>
</ul>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:10mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
The benefits should be realistic and quantifiable. If your project will, if successful, reduce 
student drop-out from 28% to 27% then that is what you should claim. If you over claim  you 
might be asked to deliver that, and then when you deliver what is actually very  worthwhile 
the project may be seen as failure as it did not deliver what was promised. It  may even be 
worth under claiming the benefits (so long as they still exceed the costs),  as delivering 
more than promised is usually seen as a good thing. Wherever possible the  benefits should 
be quantified in monetary terms, this allows the decision maker to  compare the benefits and 
 costs (which usually can be expressed in monetary terms),  and so see the return on 
investment.</div>

<blockquote class="action">
<div align="left">
<div align="left"><b>Return on investment</b></div>
<div align="left">
Formally this can be calculated as</div>
<div align="left">
ROI = (benefit - cost) / cost</div>
<div align="left">
But more usefully it can be considered to be the amount of time taken 
 for the investment (cost) to be covered by the benefit.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: 7mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 2mm;">
<b>Costs. </b>This can be expresses in financial terms or in terms of staff effort (which can 
easily be turned into financial costs. A breakdown of the main headings is useful.  If 
you want to relate the costs directly to the project plan then this may be more 
appropriately put after the project plan.</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 7mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 2mm;">
<b>Project plan.</b> You have all produced these in the past, so I don't think there is any 
need to go into any great details. I would expect a fuller description of the project,  the 
 main tasks involved and how much effort or cost each will take.</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 7mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 2mm;">
<b>Risks. </b>This is similar to the type of risk register that you might include in a JISC  bid, 
though it is useful to give an indication of the cost that risk will incur if it  occurs. This 
could be expressed financially (pounds) or as effort (person days).</li>
