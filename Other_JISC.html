<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Business Intelligence (BI)<br />
Evidence-based decision-making and the processes that gather, present, and use that 
evidence base. It can extend from providing evidence to support potential students&#8217; 
decisions about whether to apply for a course, through evidence to support individual 
faculty/department and staff members, teams and departments, to evidence to support 
strategic decisions for the whole institution. </li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Business Intelligence System (a BI system, a management dashboard) <br />

A system that compiles and presents key internal and external information in a 
concise, pictorial or graphical format, to support decision-making, planning and 
strategic thinking. It provides easy interactive access to reliable, current, good quality 
interdepartmental information, when needed. It allows senior management to be 
confident in the integrity and completeness of the information as they move between an 
overview and a detailed view. Advanced BI systems provide reliable, comprehensive 
information to all interested parties and include flexible user- defined views for senior 
managers and planning staff, and fixed views for public access and other users.</li>

: Using the JISC InfoNet BI 
Resource for guidance, this project will work with key stakeholders to re-define the 
processes that deliver the evidence base to the right users at the right time and will 
subsequently develop the BI system using Microsoft SharePoint to deliver the user 
interface (linked to appropriate data sets through the data warehouse). We will use 
this interface to simplify the process for requesting data/analysis and will provide 
personalisation facilities to enable individuals to create an interface that provides the 
data most appropriate to their needs. As part of the project we will review the JISC 
InfoNet BI resource, providing recommendations to support the evaluation of the 
product.</span></li>

significant advances in software tools that utilise in- memory technologies for the 
rapid development of three business intelligence applications (Student Lifecycle, 
Corporate Performance and Benchmarking). Information in each application will be 
presented using a range of fully interactive dashboards, scorecards and charts with 
filtering, search and drill- down and drill- up capabilities. Managers will be engaged 
throughout the project in terms of how information is presented, the design of 
dashboards, scorecards and reports and the identification of additional sources of

integrate the internal information with publicly available data on socio-economic

student backgrounds impact their future academic achievements and to help the 
University devise evidence informed policies, strategies and procedures targeted to

such a comprehensive use of meta-data to tie together disparate functional 
organisations has been utilised within the sector, making the project truly innovative.</span></li>

: Many HEIs now maintain repositories 
containing their researchers&#8223; publications. They have the potential to provide much 
information about the research strength of an HEI, as publications are the main output 
of research. The project aims to merge internal information extracted from an 
institution&#8223;s publications repository with external information (academic subject 
definitions, quality of outlets and publications), for input to a visualisation tool. The tool 
will assist research managers in making decisions which need to be based on an 
understanding of research strengths across subject areas, such as where to aim 
internal investment. In the event that the tool becomes a part of a BI resource, It could 
lead to institution vs institution comparisons and visual benchmarking for research.</span></li>

. The

consolidate usage statistics for individual articles using data from repositories and 
publishers, despite the diversity of organizational and technical environments in which 
they operate. If this is to be translated into a new, implementable COUNTER standard

following areas:</span>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=

Technical: further tests, with a wider range of repositories and a larger volume of

are scalable/extensible and work in the major repository environments. </li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 12mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Organizational: the nature and mission of the central clearing house/houses 
proposed in the original project has to be developed, and candidate 
organizations identified and tested </li>
<li style=
"margin-left: 12mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Economic: we need to assess the costs for repositories and publishers of 
generating the required usage reports, as well as the costs of any central 
clearing house/houses; investigate how these costs could be allocated between 
stakeholders </li>
<li style=
