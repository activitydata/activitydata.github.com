<h2 id="Licensing_AEIOU"><span class=outlineNumberFirst></span><span class=topicLineFirst>Activity data to Enhance and Increase Open-access Usage (AEIOU)</span></h2>

<div id="main_content"><div align="left">
The AEIOU project is aggregating activity data generated by users (both registered and 
anonymous) who download or view an item held in an institutional repository. The data used to 
describe this activity is represented by an OpenURL Context Object which is stored and 
processed to provide the shared Recommendation Service and includes the Request IP address.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>Data Protection &amp; Privacy Issues</b></div>
<div align="left">
 The IP Address identifies the computer from which the request originated and is used to provide 
the notion of a user session. Although this may not directly identify a user (eg the computer 
maybe shared publicly), in terms of Data Protection Act (DPA), IP addresses may constitute 
personal data if an individual user can be identified by using a combination of that IP address and 
other information. This applies even when personal data are anonymised after collection.</div>
<div align="left">
New European legislation came into force from May 26th 2011 and <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/advice_on_the_new_cookies_regulations.pdf"
   target="_blank"><span>The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) Code of Practice</span></a><span>
 has been revised. The Code now clearly states that 
in many cases IP addresses will be personal data, and that the DPA will therefore apply. These 
changes also apply to the use of cookies and methods for collecting and processing information 
about how a user might access and use a website. An exception exists for the use of cookies that 
are deemed "strictly necessary" for a service "explicitly" requested by a user. In general, the 
regulations advise that an assessment should be made on impact to privacy, whether this is 
strictly necessary and that the need to obtain meaningful consent should reflect this.</span></div>
<div align="left">
We also need to consider that the AEIOU project is aggregating and processing data (that 
includes IP Addresses) originating from other institutional Repositories with no direct end-user 
relationship. The <a href=
"http://edina.ac.uk/projects/Using_OpenURL_Activity_Data_Initial_Investigation_2011.pdf"
   target=
   "_blank"><span>Using OpenURL Activity Data</span></a><span>
 project has addressed this by notifying institutions 
that sign up for their OpenURL resolver service. We have no explicit agreement with the partners 
involved in the current project but aim to review their existing privacy policies should the service be 
continued. For example, do policies for storing and processing user data include repository 
reporting software and Google analytics and should users be made aware of this through the 
repository website?</span></div>
<div align="left">
 The current cookie policy for Aberystwyth University can be found <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cookie-policy/"
   target="_blank"><span>here</span></a></div>
<div align="left">
In order to comply with recent changes to ICO code of practice we have been advised that as a 
minimum requirement we should include text in the header or footer of repository web pages and a 
link to a <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2160/7202"
target=
"_blank"><span>Data Privacy Policy</span></a><span> that clearly informs users about how their data is being used and 
whether it is passed to third parties (eg Google). Where possible, they should also be given the 
option to opt out of supplying personal information (IP address) to the Recommendation service. 
This would not affect them receiving recommendations but their information would not be stored or 
processed as part of the service.</span></div>
<div align="left">
<b>Anonymisation &amp; Re-use of data</b></div>
<div align="left">
We will make data available to individual partners and hope to provide a reporting service (based on 
the activity data) so that institutions can view usage statistics in a National context. We also hope 
to publicly release the data with regard to personal data encryption and licensing outlined below. 
Ideally, we would like to release <a href="http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler/extension?verb=GetMetadata&amp;metadataPrefix=xsd&amp;identifier=info:ofi/fmt:xml:xsd:ctx"
   target=
   "_blank"><span>OpenURL Context Object data as XML</span></a><span>
 but in the short term this 
will be made available in CSV format.</span></div>
<div align="left">
The JISC Usage Statistics Review looked at European legal constraints for recording and 
aggregating log files and noted that the processing of IP- addresses is strongly regulated in certain 
countries (e.g. Germany) and that current interpretation maybe ambiguous. In such cases, they 
advise that "To avoid legal problems it would be best to pseudonymize IP- addresses shortly after 
the usage event or not to use IP-addresses at all but to promote the implementation of some sort 
of session identification, which does not record IP- addresses"</div>
<div align="left">
Currently, we are encrypting the IP addresses using an MD5 hash algorithm recommended in 
Knowledge Exchange Usage Statistics Guidelines so that personal data is anonymised. Although 
MD5 is a relatively fast and efficient algorithm it has been shown to have security vulnerabilities 
and other more secure methods for encryption (eg SHA-1 &amp; SHA-2) are recommended. If this 
becomes an issue we could release data with stronger encryption or replace the IP address with a 
system identifier as suggested above. Removing the IP address would, however, compromise the 
ability to aggregate data.</div>
<div align="left">
The Knowledge Exchange Usage Statistics Guidelines also point out that when the IP address is 
obfuscated, information about the geographic location is lost. They therefore recommend using the 
C- Class subnet part of the IP address which will give a regional (network) location but can not 
identify a personal computer. This would be appropriate where activity data is used for reporting 
statistics.</div>
