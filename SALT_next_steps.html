<div id="main_content"><div align="left">
There are a number of steps that can be taken as a result of this project - some imminent &#8216;quick 
wins&#8217; which we plan to take on after the official end, and then others that are &#8216;bigger&#8217; than this 
project.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>What we plan to do next anyway:</b></div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;"><a href=
"http://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/1453" target=
"_blank"><span>Adjust the threshold</span></a><span> to a higher level (using the &#8216;usefulness&#8217; benchmark given to us as users 
as a basis) so as to suppress some of the more off- base recommendations our users were 
bemused by.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Implement the recommender in the <a href=
"http://catalogue.library.manchester.ac.uk/" target=
"_blank"><span>JRUL library search interface</span></a><span>
.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Once the threshold has been reset, consider implementing the recommender as an option 
feature in the new COPAC interface. We &#8217;d really like to, but we &#8217;d need to assess if the 
results are too JRUL- centric.</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Work with JRUL to determine most appropriate mechanisms for hosting the data and 
supporting the API in the longer term (decisions here are dependent on how, if at all, we 
continue with this work from a Shared Services perspective)</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Work with JRUL to assess the impact of this in the longer term (on user satisfaction, and on 
borrowing behaviour)</li>
</ul>
<div align="left">
<b>The Big Picture (what else we &#8217;d like to see happen):</b></div>
<div align="left">
1. <b>Aggregate more data</b>. Combine the normalised data from JRUL with processed data from 
additional libraries that represent a wider range of institutions, including learning and teaching. Our 
hunch is that only a few more would make the critical difference in ironing out some of the skewed 
results we get from focusing on one data set (i.e. results skewed to JRUL course listings)</div>
<div align="left">
2. <b>Assess longer term impact</b>. Longer-term analysis of the impact of the recommender 
functionality on JRUL user satisfaction and borrowing behaviour. Is there, as with Huddersfield, 
more borrowing from &#8216;across the shelf&#8217;? Is our original hypothesis borne out?</div>
<div align="left">
3. <b>Requirements and costs gathering for a shared service</b>. Establish the requirements and 
potential costs for a shared service to support processing, aggregation, and sharing of activity data 
via an API. Based on this project, we have a fair idea of what those requirements might be, but our 
experience with JRUL indicates that such provision need to adequately support the handling and 
processing of large quantities of data. How much FTE, processing power, and storage would we 
need if we scaled to handling more libraries? Part of this requirements gathering exercise would 
involve identifying additional contributing libraries, and the size of their data.</div>
<div align="left">
4. <b>Experiment with different UI designs and algorithm thresholds to support different use 
cases.</b> For example, undergraduate users vs &#8216;advanced&#8217; researcher users might benefit from the 
thresholds being set differently; in addition, there are users who want to see items held elsewhere 
and how to get them vs those who don't. Some libraries will be keen to manage user expectations 
if they are &#8216;finding&#8217; stock that&#8217;s not held at the home institution.</div>
<div align="left">
5. <b>Establish more recipes</b> to simplify data extraction from the more common LMS&#8217;s beyond Talis 
(Horizon, ExLibris Voyager, and Innovative).</div>
<div align="left">
6. <b>Investigate how local activity data can help collections managers</b> identify collection 
strengths and recognise items that should be retained because of association with valued 
collections. We thought about this as a form of &#8220;stock management by association.&#8221; Librarians 
might treat some long- tail items (eg items with limited borrowing) with caution if they were aware 
of links/associations to other collections (although there is also the caveat that this wouldn't be 
possible with local activity data reports in isolation)</div>
<div align="left">
 7. <b>More ambitiously, investigate how nationally aggregated activity data could support 
activities such as stock weeding by revealing collection strengths or gaps</b> and allowing 
librarians to cross check against other collections nationally. This could also inform the number of 
copies a library should buy, and which books from reading lists are required in multiple copies. </div>
<div align="left">
8. <b>Learning and teaching support.</b> Explore the relationship between recommended lists and 
reading lists, and how it can be used as a tool to support academic teaching staff.</div>
<div align="left">
9. <b>Communicate the benefits to decision-makers.</b> If work were to continue along these lines, 
then a recommendation that has come out strongly from our collaborators is the need to 
accompany any development activity with a targeted communications plan, which continually 
articulates the benefits of utilising activity data to support search to decision- makers within 
libraries. While within our community a significant amount of momentum is building in this area, 
our meetings with librarians indicates that the &#8216;why should I care?&#8217; and more to the point &#8216;why 
should I make this a priority?&#8217; questions are not adequately answered. In a nutshell, &#8216;leveraging 
activity data&#8217; can easily fall down or off the priority lists of most library managers. It would be 
particularly useful to tie these benefits to the strategic aims and objectives of University libraries 
as a means to get such work embedded in annual operational planning.</div></div>
