<h2 id="dataprotection_STAR-Trak"><span class=outlineNumberFirst></span><span class=topicLineFirst>Student Tracking And Retention: STAR-Trak: NG</span></h2>

<div id="main_content"><div align="left">The <a href=
"STAR-Trak.html#STAR-Trak"><span>STAR-Trak</span></a><span> project wrote:</span></div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span><b>Data</b>: In an earlier incarnation of our proposal to JISC we postulated creation of an activity 
data set that might form the basis for a future national schema and dataset. The ultimately 
very good advice (thank you!) we received was that was too ambitious a goal for this 
project, and so our data is for internal use only, removing the need to consider </span>
<a href=
"Anonymisation_guide.html#Anonymisation_guide"><span>anonymisation</span></a><span>
. We have not managed to run a &#8220;live&#8221; pilot during the term of the project, and 
so there is no live data in the application. Moving forwards our basic position is that we are 
simply consuming data that already exists in our IT ecosystem - nothing new is created. 
That is not quite true as we have added functionality to capture interactions between 
student and tutor, extra-curricular activities and use of the system creates new data. 
However there is nothing innovative in this data that requires us to treat it differently from 
similar data elsewhere.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>Of course what has changed is that data that was previously hidden or only available with 
difficulty and/or to certain people is now available to a wider set of people, and we have had 
to consider the privacy implications of that. To recap on the basic STAR-Trak functionality, 
it allows the student to see their own information from the student record system and 
activity data from the systems that they use to support their learning activities. It also 
allows tutors, module and course leaders to view this information on a course, module or 
student basis. We made the decision that trying to map relationships between staff and 
students as a basis for deciding who can see what, while great in theory, was not going to 
be sustainable in practice. These relationships may or may not be defined in external 
systems and they can be quite fluid. The combination of these two factors makes 
maintaining the relationships potentially a heavy administrative burden that would not be 
sustained, resulting in the system becoming unusable over time.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>As an alternative we have implemented what we call &#8220;social controls&#8221;. In simple terms this 
has two elements to its operation:</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>1) it allows a student to block all or any member of staff from seeing anything bar their very 
basic data (their name and what course they are on)</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>2) any member of staff [authorised to use the system] can explicitly define in the 
application a relationship with a student (personal tutor, module tutor etc) and by doing so 
they can then view the student&#8217;s details (subject to 1 above). However a record is created 
in the application noting the relationship and this can be audited.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>This is further strengthened by participation in STAR-Trak being fully voluntary on the 
students part.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>We view this control system as an innovative experiment to be validated under strict trial 
conditions. We have already identified several enhancements that may improve the level of 
confidence in such a system. As per previous post we are still working hard to get formal 
commitment to running a year-long pilot of STAR-Trak and this continues to move in the 
right direction, albeit slowly (from the project&#8217;s perspective!). It is only in practice that we 
will see how successful we have been in developing a usable and useful application that 
meets data compliance requirements. As Chuck Reid famously said &#8220;In theory, there is no 
difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is&#8221;.</span></div>
