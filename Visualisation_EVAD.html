<div id="main_content"><div align="left">The <a href=
"Exposing_VLE_data.html#Exposing_VLE_data"><span>EVAD</span></a><span>
 project has demonstrated a number of visualisations including the use of Gephi to show 
connections between sites within the VLE (See </span><a href="./"><span>How to work with Gephi to visualise a network of Sites connected by Users</span></a><span> for details on how to do this)</span></div>

<div align="left">
They also used visualisation to demonstrate patterns of VLE usage:</div>
<div align="left">
The top 2 events were found to be reading content (green - 44% of events logged) and user logins 
(dark green - 22% of events logged). The chart below shows monthly counts for these events.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage6.jpg"
align="bottom" width="735" height="492" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /><br />
Whilst the content read shows a regular peak in Oct/Nov with a secondary peak around May, the 
logins do not show such a clear pattern. Both show a clear gradual underlying increase over the 
years. More investigation would be needed to find out exactly what is causing the peaks in logins. 
This is especially the case since it bears little relation to the number of user logouts recorded (see 
later graph).</div>
<div align="left">
The following shows a weekly count for content read giving more granularity of when exactly the 
peaks are. The main peaks are repeated in late October with secondary peaks in Feb and mid- 
June.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage7.jpg"
align="bottom" width="541" height="394" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
This considers weekly counts over the last year. (Feb 2010-2011). </div>
<div align="left">Term dates were:</div>
<div align="left">
<b>12</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> January - 12</b><b><sup>
th</sup></b><b> March 2010. </b>Easter (5th April 2010) shows a slight dip.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>20</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> April - 11</b><b><sup>
th</sup></b><b> June 2010. </b>A gradual increase with a peak at the end of May.</div>
<div align="left">
This coincides with the examination period. There is a long dip over the summer vacation period.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>5</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> October-3</b><b><sup>rd</sup></b><b>
 December 2010 </b>First peak is early October with the highest peak at the end of 
October. This peak at the end of October might not be expected and it would be interesting to find 
out more about what is going on here. There is a large dip over the Christmas period </div>
<div align="left">
<b>18</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> January - 18</b><b><sup>
th</sup></b><b> March 2011</b>. There is a wide peak during January and early February.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage10.jpg"
align="bottom" width="516" height="228" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
Although content read does have a peak at the start of the Academic Year in October, there is a 
higher peak in November. It would be interesting to investigate if there is an explanation for this 
peak half way through the term &#8211; such as a large number of students starting assignments which 
rely on Camtools. </div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage13.jpg"
align="bottom" width="547" height="293" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
This shows the next active events in terms of counts. Note the scale is roughly 10% of that for 
viewing content and logging in. However the overall peaks for site visits, search and user logout 
very much mirror those for viewing connect and logins showing consistent periods of peak activity 
corresponding to term dates.</div>
<div align="left">
As one might expect, lots of new content (blue line) has been added each October, at the start of 
the academic year, but there is a more recent and much higher peak in January of this year.</div>
<div align="left">
The following series of charts show analysis of the next highest peaks broken down by event type. 
Note the scale is several times smaller that that for reading content.</div>
<div align="left">
The calendar event is logged when users create (red line) or revise (yellow line) site calendars 
which may be used to display lecture times, assignment submission dates and so on. There is a 
clear October peak for both creating and revising calendars.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage14.jpg"
align="bottom" width="547" height="319" border="0" alt=

align="bottom" width="543" height="324" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
This tool has been added in the last few years and is used to for student surveys. The green 
update peaks in February would correspond to lecturers preparing surveys at this point which are 
returned by students roughly a month later (blue line).</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage16.jpg"
align="bottom" width="521" height="292" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /><br />
The counts for Wiki activity show a peak in new material just prior to the October start of year with 
high revision activity at the start of October.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage17.jpg"
align="bottom" width="529" height="194" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
Site Maintenance demonstrates a clear October peak with a secondary peak in Jan/Feb. There is 
clearly a gradual increase in the number of sites being updated (red line) whereas the number of 
new sites (blue line) has levelled off.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage18.jpg"
align="bottom" width="526" height="269" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
Permissions changes reflect people being added or updated on sites. Again peak activity is in 
October.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage19.jpg"
align="bottom" width="538" height="276" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
Forums again show a peak in October but their usage looks like it has tailed off.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage20.jpg"
align="bottom" width="509" height="282" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
The chat tool also shows peaks in October and for the last year in November too.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage21.jpg"
align="bottom" width="517" height="230" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
Again the roster tool, which is used to view other members of a site shows peak usage in October.</div>
<div align="left">
One area that I was particularly asked to look at was the Tests and Quizzes (T&amp;Q) tool. The scale 
for this is again of a much smaller order of magnitude but again shows October peaks:</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage22.jpg"
align="bottom" width="538" height="290" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
This final chart shows the overall totals for each month (blue) and the monthly totals excluding 
logins and content read (orange). This again shows a peak in October and other peaks 
corresponding to the terms. There is not much growth, in terms of event counts, over recent years 
in these other activities.</div>
<div align="left"><img src="NotesImages/Topic99NotesImage23.jpg"
align="bottom" width="539" height="275" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><span style=
"font-size:12pt"><b>Conclusions</b></span></div>
<div align="left">
Many activities show a clear usage peak corresponding with the start of the Academic year in 
October. However reading content, which accounts for over 44% of the counts, has a higher peak 
in November than in October. It would be interesting to learn exactly what is causing this 
November peak.</div>
<div align="left">
It also seems likely, given the different pattern in logouts, that the high spikes in login activity seen 
in the first chart are caused by spurious data and further investigation is needed here.</div></div>
