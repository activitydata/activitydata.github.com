<h2 id="Collecting-LIDP"><span class=outlineNumberFirst></span><span class=topicLineFirst>Library Impact Data Project (LIDP)</span></h2>

<div id="main_content"><div align="left"><a href=
"LIDP.html#LIDP"><span>LIDP</span></a><span> which used library data from seven universities ran into problems at some universities. 
Liverpool John Moore's University (LJMU) reported:</span></div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>"Energised by the initial project team meeting, the LIDP team at LJMU set about gathering 
the required data in order to make our contribution to the project. Having already had a few 
discussions we were fairly confident that we would be able to gather the required data. We 
had access to student records and numbers, Athens data, library usage data from Aleph 
and we were aware that our security system (gate entry into the library) kept a historic 
record of each individual&#8217;s entry and exit into the buildings which are serviced through the 
swipe card entry system. We just needed to pull all this together through the unique 
student number.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>"Getting this particular bit of data from our Academic Planning department was 
straightforward. An anonymised list of all 2010 graduating students, along with their 
programme of study and degree classification, and most importantly their unique id number 
was duly provided.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>"<b>Hurdle one</b> - Our security system does indeed log and track student movement through 
the use of the swipe card entry system, but we are unable to get the system to report on 
this. All data from the system is archived by the system supplier and is subsequently not 
readily available to us. This means that entry into the Learning Resource Centres is not 
going to be something we can report upon on this occasion.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>"<b>Hurdle two</b> - Our Network team systematically delete student network accounts upon 
graduation, which means the record that links an individual&#8217;s unique student ID number, 
Athens account, security number and Library barcode is not available for the students 
whose library usage we wished to analyse!</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>"There were about 4,500 students who graduated from LJMU in 2010 with undergraduate 
degrees, but unfortunately, by the time I got to speak to the network manager, 3,000 of 
these had been deleted, as is our institutional practice and policy.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>"The upshot of all this is that we are only going to be able to provide data for a third of the 
potential students that we could have provided data for if we had thought to ask these 
questions earlier on. But at least we are still able to contribute."</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left">
The project then reflected on the data more widely</div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>Following on from </span><a href=
"Collecting_LIDP.html#Collecting_LIDP"><span>De Montfort&#8217;s blog post</span></a><span>
 about the nature of their data submission, we've 
been thinking a bit more about what we could have included (and indeed what we might 
look at when we finish this project).</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>We've already been thinking about how we could incorporate well established surveys into 
data consideration (both our own internal data collection, such as our library satisfaction 
survey, and external surveys). While our biggest concern is getting enough data to draw 
conclusions, qualitative data is naturally a problematic area: numerical data &#8216;just&#8217; needs 
obtaining and clearing for use, but getting some information from students to find out why 
they do or don't use resources and the library can be quite complicated. Using other 
surveys outside of the project focus groups could be a way of gathering simple yet 
informative data to indicate trends and personal preferences. Additionally, if certain groups 
of students choose to use the library a little or a lot, existing surveys may give us feedback 
on why on a basic level.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>We also may want to ask (and admittedly I'm biased here given my research background!) 
what makes students choose the library for studying and just how productive they are when 
they get here. Footfall has already clearly demonstrated in the original project that library 
entries do not necessarily equate to degree results. Our library spaces have been designed 
for a variety of uses, for social learning, group study, individual study, specialist subject 
areas. However, that doesn't mean they are used for those purposes. Footfall can mean 
checking email and logging on to Facebook (which of course then links back to computer 
log in data and how that doesn't necessarily reflect studying), but it can also mean 
intensive group preparation eg law students working on a moot (perhaps without using 
computers or resources other than hard copy reference editions of law reports).</span></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span>If we want to take the data even further, we could take it deeper into borrowing in terms of 
specific collection usage too. Other research (De Jager, K (2002) has found significant 
correlations between specific hard copy collections (in De Jager&#8217;s case, examples include 
reference materials and short loan items) and attainment, with similar varying relationships 
between resource use and academic achievement across different subjects. If we were to 
break down collection type in our borrowing analysis (particularly where there may be 
special collections of materials or large numbers of shorter loan periods), would we find 
anything that would link up to electronic resource use as a comparison? We could also 
consider incorporating reading lists into the data to check whether recommended texts are 
used heavily in high attainment groups&#8230;</span></div>
