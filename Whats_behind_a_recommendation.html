<h2 id="Whats_behind_a_recommendation"><span class=outlineNumberFirst></span><span class=topicLineFirst>What’s behind a recommendation?</span></h2>

<div id="main_content"><div align="left"><b>Topic</b></div>
<div align="left">
This guide is about types of recommendations that might be desirable to use in different 
situations, together with notes about the kinds of activity data needed to make the 
recommendations</div>
<div align="left"><b>The problem</b></div>
<div align="left">
Recommendations, such as those embedded in services like Amazon and iTunes, are typically 
based on attention (navigation, search) and activity (transaction) data, though they may also take 
account of user generated ratings. Different types of recommendation need different levels of data. </div>
<div align="left">For example,</div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style="margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;"><span><i>&#8216;People who bought that also bought this&#8217; </i></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left">
requires less data to recommend than either </div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span><i>&#8216;People who bought that bought this next&#8217; </i></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left">or </div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left" style=
"margin-left:11mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm;">
<span><i>&#8216;People like you bought this&#8217;</i>.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left">
The initial problem is to identify, for a given service what kind of recommendations might be 
offered. </div>
<div align="left">
These recommendations will have particular activity data demands as to the activity data to be 
collected, preserved, collated and processed. You should check availability of the data sources, 
possibly using a pre-prepared list of activity data sources (as recommended elsewhere in these 
guides). You should also check if you can use the data within the bounds of your corporate 
Privacy Policy (again please see elsewhere in these guides).</div>
<div align="left"><b>The solution</b></div>
<div align="left">
Services need to make a list of the recommendations that they would like to offer, identifying the 
data required for each. </div>
<div align="left">
To save you doing that from scratch, here is a list of broad yet distinct recommendation types and 
the generic data from which they might be derived.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>Generic recommendation types</b></div>
<div align="left">
<b>[A] People who did that also did this</b> &#8211; a list of all transactions (e.g. book circulation records) 
with anonymised user IDs and no further user details </div>
<div align="left">
<b>[B] People who looked at that also looked at this </b>&#8211; a variation on [A] based on &#8216;attention&#8217;, 
perhaps signified by retrievals of full details catalogue pages</div>
<div align="left">
<b>[C] People who did that did this next / first</b> &#8211; as per [A] but this will need a time stamp</div>
<div align="left">
<b>[D] - People like you also did this</b> - &#8216;Like you&#8217; can be in a different league of difficulty, depending 
on how you define &#8216;like you&#8217;; you can cheat and treat it as a variation on [A] where likeness is 
based on activity. However, in education we might expect &#8216;like you&#8217; to be based on a scholarly 
context &#8211; such as a Course or even a Module or perhaps a discipline and a level (e.g. 
Undergraduate Physicists, First Year Historians) &#8211; all of which implies personal data, with each 
transaction linked to a user and their context.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>[E] - People like you rated this</b> &#8211; A variation on [D] that is possible if your system collects 
ratings such as stars or a &#8216;liked&#8217; / &#8216;useful&#8217; indicator.</div>
<div align="left">
<b>[F] - New items that may interest you</b> &#8211; This &#8216;awareness&#8217; service requires no information about 
other users, simply using a &#8216;precise-enough&#8217; catalogue code (e.g. Subject heading or Dewey class 
in libraries) to link the user&#8217;s previous activity to new items. </div>
<div align="left">
<b>The following are particularly interesting in libraries, though they could be supported 
elsewhere</b></div>
<div align="left">
<b>[G] People who searched using this term ended up viewing / borrowing in these subject 
areas</b> &#8211; building a mapping from search terms to the eventual classification of choice may help 
with accessing classifications that differ from the key words used in teaching; this does not need 
data about individual users</div>
<div align="left">
<b>[H] The following alternative titles are available</b> &#8211; at its simplest, this can use such as 
Dewey codes or reading lists to recommend alternatives; whilst this does not have to involve 
individual user data, the recommendation could be enhanced based on &#8216;people like you&#8217;.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Taking it further</b></div>
<div align="left">
The first steps are to determine </div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
What sort of recommendations you could offer in order to assess the user experience</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Which events you would need to capture in order to generate those recommendations</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
What the recommendation algorithm is, or how feasible it is to design an algorithm, possibly 
experimentally</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
What supporting personal context data would be desirable</li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
Whether capturing additional data would enable to support a wider range of recommendation 
types at a later stage</li>
</ul>
<div align="left"><b>Additional resources</b></div>
<div align="left">
As illustrated in Dave Pattern&#8217;s presentation, the University of Huddersfield has identified a range 
of recommendation types that can be derived from library activity data &#8211;

 </span></div>
<div align="left">The <a href=
"RISE.html"><span>RISE</span></a><span> and </span><a href="SALT.html"><span>SALT</span></a><span> projects also 
focused on recommender services based for library resources. The OpenURL project developed a 
recommender as a by-product of other work (<a href="http://edina.ac.uk/cgi-bin/news.cgi?filename=2011-08-09-openurldata.txt">http://edina.ac.uk/cgi-bin/news.cgi?filename=2011-08-09-openurldata.txt</span></a>).</div>
<div align="left">
Websites such as Amazon illustrate a range of activity-based recommendations; you might 
consider what data lies behind each type. For your own account, consider what they need to know 
about you and about other users &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">
