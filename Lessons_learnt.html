<div id="main_content"><div align="left">
One of the key purposes of the activity data programme was that other universities and colleges 
should be able to learn lessons from the work of the projects in order to make it easier for others 
to build on the work of the projects. Here we draw together some of the key lessons learnt by the 
projects and either reported by themselves or observed by us as part of our synthesis work.</div>
<div align="left">
The lessons learnt can be divided into the following areas:</div>
<div align="left">
<b>Legal issues (data protection, privacy, anonymisation)</b></div>
<div align="left">
All the projects addressed issues around data protection and how they could ensure the privacy of 
the users of the systems. While there is no simple solution to this, one of the key points was 
would the data be traceable back to an individual? Clearly, some information would make this 
easy. For instance names and user IDs are easy to trace to an individual. There was however 
considerable discussion about whether or not IP addresses are personal information, and can be 
used to identify people. While in many cases it will not be possible (for instance because they are 
using a shared computer or the request is coming via a proxy and a single IP address may appear 
for a whole institution) in other cases it may be easy as users are using a fixed IP address.</div>

<div align="left"><b>Data (scale, quality)</b></div>
<div align="left">
Several of the projects commented on the importance of data quality. There are several aspects to 
this including the completeness of the data, how up to date the data is, the signal noise ratio and 
the actual information itself.</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;"><a href=
"AEIOU.html#AEIOU"><span>AEIOU</span></a><span> commented that the data can contain a lot of noise which can impact on performance, 
and that data will grow rapidly, so you need to think big from the start. For further details see </span>
<a href=
"LL_data_AEIOU.html#LL_data_AEIOU"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li style=

"AGtivity.html#AGtivity"><span>AGtivity</span></a><span> suggest that you should log as much data and for as long as possible in order to 
capture long- term trends, and note that scripting and regular expressions are key to 
extracting useful information from the large quantity of unrelated data. Future work could and 
should consider further recipes and advice.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;"><a href=
"LIDP.html#LIDP"><span>LIDP</span></a><span> warn of the importance of retaining data for later analysis and that this needs to be 
thought about early. They also warn that you need to consider what the data means 
particularly around the use of e- resources. For further details see </span><a href="LL_legal_LIDP.html#LL_legal_LIDP">
<span>here</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The <a href=
"OpenURL.html#OpenURL"><span>OpenURL</span></a><span> project also commented that </span><font face="F0">
<span>release of data facilitates unanticipated use, 
which meant that the effort expended in sharing OpenURL knowledge was worthwhile as it 
expanded the data fields that have been made available and enabled an analysis of the quality 
of the data set by others that was not originally anticipated. They also found it necessary to 
have large volumes of data in order to identify sessions. For further details see </span></font><a href="LL_data_OpenURL.html#LL_data_OpenURL">

of the other (cataloguing data) that they needed to link to and expose in order to create the 
recommendations.</span></li>

Whilst <a href=
"SALT.html#SALT"><span>SALT</span></a><span> had 10 years of data available to them they found that a good recommendation 
service could be based on as little as five weeks worth of data, so it may not be necessary to 
have huge volumes of data. For further details see </span><a href="LL_data_SALT.html#LL_data_SALT">

<b>Understanding and presenting the data</b></div>
<div align="left">
Several of the projects discussed the importance of presenting the data in ways that are 
meaningful to users. AGtivity commented that one should consider visualisations and statistics 
results for users at an early stage and then be adaptable and agile to change. User requirements 
change and one should with them.</div>

<div align="left"><b>Recommender systems</b></div>
<div align="left">
Recommendations based on user activity can be very powerful, as demonstrated by Amazon 
amongst others. The number of recommendations offered can have a powerful bearing on the 
usefulness of the recommendations. Too few and nothing useful may turn up; too many and it can 
be overwhelming. AEIOU suggest that 5 or 6 is about right.</div>
