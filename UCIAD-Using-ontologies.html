<h2 id="UCIAD-Using-ontologies"><span class=outlineNumberFirst></span><span class=topicLineFirst>UCIAD: Using, refining, customising and reusing ontologies</span></h2>

<div id="main_content"><div align="left">
Ontology modelling is a never ending task. Elements constantly need to be corrected and added 
to cover more and more cases in a way as generic as possible. It is even more the case in UCIAD 
as the approach is to create the ontology depending on the data we need to treat. Therefore, as 
we will progressively be adding more data from different sources, including server logs from 
different types of web sites, activity logs from systems such as VLEs or video players, the 
ontologies will evolve to include these cases. </div>
<div align="left">
Going a step further, what we want to investigate is the user-centric analysis of activity data. The 
ontologies will be used to provide users with views and analysis mechanisms for the data that 
concern their own activities. It therefore seems a natural next step to make it possible for the 
users to extend the ontologies, to customize them, therefore creating their own view on their own 
data.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Reusing existing ontology</b></div>
<div align="left">
When dealing with data and ontologies, reuse is generally seen as a good practice. Apart from 
saving time from not having to remodel things that have already been described elsewhere, it also 
helps anticipating on future needs for interoperability by choosing well established ontologies that 
are likely to have been employed elsewhere. We therefore investigated existing ontologies that 
could help us define the notions mentioned above. Here are the ontology we reused:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/" target=
"_blank"><span>Friend of a Friend (FOAF)</span></a><span>
 ontology is commonly used to describe people, their 
connections with other people, but also their connections with documents. We use FOAF in 
the Actor Ontology for human users, and on the Sitemap Ontology for Web pages (as 
Documents). </span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/" target=
"_blank"><span>Time Ontology</span></a><span> is a common ontology for representing time and temporal intervals. We 
use it in the Trace Ontology.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The Action ontology defines different types of actions in a broad sense, and can be used as a 
basis for representing elements of the requests in the Trace Ontology, but also as a base 
typology for the Activity ontology. It itself imports a number of other ontologies, including its 
own notion of actors. </li>
</ul>
<div align="left">
The graph representing the dependencies between the UCIAD ontologies and others is 
represented below.</div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic135NotesImage6.jpg"
align="bottom" width="439" height="337" border="0" alt=
"graphic" /></div>
<div align="left">
While not currently used in the base ontologies, other ontologies can be considered at a later 
stage, for example to model specific types of activities. These include the <a href="http://online-presence.net/ontology.php"
   target="_blank"><span>Online Presence Ontology (OPO)</span></a><span>, as well as the </span><a href="http://sioc-project.org/ontology"
   target=
   "_blank"><span>Semantically- Interlinked Online Communities ontology (SIOC)</span></a><span>
.</span></div>
<div align="left">
<b>Identifying concepts and their relations</b></div>
<div align="left">
The first step in building our ontology is to identify the key concepts, i.e., the key notions, that 
need to be tackled, bearing in mind that the ultimate goal is to understand activities. The main 
concepts to be considered are therefore the ones that support the concept of activity. Activities 
relate to users, but not only. The system relies extensively on website logs as sources of activity 
data. In these cases, it is possible to investigate requests both from human users and from robots 
automatically retrieving and crawling information from the websites. The server logs in question 
represent collections can be seen as traces of activities that these users/robots are realising on 
websites. therefore it is necessary to model these other aspects, which correspond to actions that 
are realised by actors on particular resources. These are the three kinds of objects that, in the 
context of Web platforms, the system to models, so that they can be interpreted and classified in 
terms of activities. The project therefore proposes four ontologies to be used as the basis of the 
work in UCIAD:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The <a href=
"https://github.com/uciad/UCIAD-Ontologies/blob/master/actor.owl"
target=
"_blank"><span>Actor Ontology</span></a><span> is an ontology representing different types of actors (human users vs 
robots), as well as the technical setting through which they realise online activities (computer 
and user agent).</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The <a href=
"https://github.com/uciad/UCIAD-Ontologies/blob/master/sitemap.owl"
target=
"_blank"><span>Sitemap Ontology</span></a><span> is an ontology to represent the organisation of web pages in collections 
and websites, and which is extensible to represent different types of web pages and websites.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The <a href=
"https://github.com/uciad/UCIAD-Ontologies/blob/master/trace.owl"
target=
"_blank"><span>Trace Ontology</span></a><span> is an ontology to represent traces of activities, realised by particular 
agents on particular web pages. As the current focus is on HTTP server logs, this ontology 
contain specific sections related to traces as HTTP requests (e.g., methods as actions and 
HTTP response code). It is however extensible to other types of traces, such as specific logs 
for VLEs or search systems.</span></li>
<li style=
"margin-left: -4mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm;">
The Activity Ontology is intended to define particular classes of activities into which traces 
can be classified, depending on their particular parameters (including actors and web pages). 
The type of activities to consider highly depends on the systems considered and to a certain 
extent on the user. The idea here is that specific versions of the ontology will be built that fit 
the specific needs of particular systems. It is the possible to extract the generic and globally 
reusable part of these ontologies to provide a base for an overarching activity ontology. 
Ultimately, the idea in UCIAD is that individual users will be able to manipulate this ontology 
to include their specific view on their own activities.</li>
